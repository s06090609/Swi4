Warning!
I could not establish remote connection to PostgreSQL from another machine with another network (Even with help of my Senior Developer friends),
thus function "create_db_and_add_data" may not work if you don't 
have established PostgreSQL server with following properties:

database="unwind_digital_db",
user='postgres',
password='admin',
host='localhost', #alternative host for different LOCAL machines '192.168.0.108',
port= '5432'

If you have a database with following properties THE CODE DOES WORK and the data will be updated on your local server. 

If you have any questions regarding the execution or methods don't hessitate to contact me at denis.ryabich.swi4@gmail.com or denis-ryabich@mail.ru
